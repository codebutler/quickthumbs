Installation
------------

* Type 'make' from inside the 'src' directory
* Copy everything in the 'web' directory (including a few dot files!) to
  somewhere on your web server and configure that directory as an asp.net
  application.

* Alternatively, you can simply run 'xsp' from within the 'web' directory
  and point your browser to http://localhost:8080/. 
  
  This is a good way to make sure everything is working, before moving on to
  configuring apache/mod_mono.
